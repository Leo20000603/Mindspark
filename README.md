# Mindspark

I am the Co-Founder and COO of Mindspark Summer, which is a summer camp that teaches students on different topics of computer science. 
We had courses on Website Development and Java Programming. This repository is for the projects used in the two week long camp for Java Programming.

My involvement in the company is that I wrote and developped the Java Programming Course Curriculum. Also, I helped advertise the summer program by going to various faires and events.

In the end, we sold over 40 sessions and over $14,000 in sales.
